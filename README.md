Got the opportunity to use flask for an API & Web Visualization of Scraped Pricing data

Funny enough the source of the information scraped was named after me. Applied to Datopian a while ago and this guy assigned it to me(https://github.com/rufuspollock).

It's really funny when I look at it ( Henry Hub:( )
